go through a set of test images with GROUND TRUTH LABELS and calculate
the mAP (mean average precision) to see how well the edge TPU is doing 

- creates a csv of annotations, then use eyal and jenya's script

1. where are the output images?
     - on the edge TPU
     - /mnt/validation_images_final_paper_waymo_construction/waymo_construction

    - run_map_csv.sh
    - saves csv of annotations on ALL IMAGES, change MAX_IMAGES to get less

2. can we just run on a few examples to see how the models do?
    - run_few_images_save_annotations.sh
    - retrain_model_run_few_images_save_annotations.sh [model trained after a long time]
