- key note:
	- this code was FIRST tested on the coral dev board, where the edge TPU API was downloaded at: 
	- CODE_DIR=/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/edgetpu/demo/

	- we also tested it as of Jan 2020 using the edgetpu API version 2.12.2
	  on a Raspberry Pi 4 and Coral Edge TPU USB accelerator, which works
	- for this, use CODE_DIR=/usr/share/edgetpu/examples

- check the basic demo scripts:
    - verify_setup
    - run_classify_demo.sh
    - object_detect_demo.sh
    - these are essentially copied from the website

- run these again with OUR re-trained models
    - custom_retrained_model_detect_demo.sh
    - output images are here: edgetpu_dev_board_release/output_images/harvestnet_retrained
