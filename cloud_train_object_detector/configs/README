key parts of config file to change for a new application/dataset:

num_classes
    - should match label file, we had 13

fine_tune_checkpoint:
    - where is the model.ckpt you downloaded from google?

label_map_path:
    - label files
    - NOTE THIS STARTS FROM 1

input_path:
    - list of tfrecords for train, val data

    - eg: 
        - input_path: ["/HD1Data/HarvestNet/final_paper_results/training_data_tfrecords/waymo_new_train.record", "/HD1Data/HarvestNet/final_paper_results/training_data_tfrecords/construction_new_train.record"]

graph_rewriter:
    - delay: if you train for 50k steps, means start quantization say at 48k steps
